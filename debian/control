 underlying the IDE portion of the Eclipse Platform. This includes the
 central concepts of resources (projects, folders, and files), builders,
 natures, resource change listeners, etc.
 .
 This package contains the org.eclipse.core.filesystem bundle which provides
 an abstract, generic file system API, including an implementation of this
 API for the local file system. This is the API through which the resources
